# in Part2
I used H2-database

If you try to access a non-existent id, the error "Could not be found employee id" is output.
I registered two employees in the database in advance through "LoadDatabase.java".
(1) name = "Pang", role = "teacher"
(2) name = "Taejun", role = "student"

# Get
if you want Get all empolyees, you should type like the example below
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/employees/all

if you want Get by id, you should type like the example bleow
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/employees/1

After this command, my program return employee's id

# Post
if you want register employee, you should type like the example bleow
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/employees -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{"name": "Samwise Gamgee", "role": "gardener"}'

The id is determined in the order in which it is registered. Therfore, Since there are already 2 data in the database, if you save new data, id starts from 3.

# Put
if you want modify employee, you should type like the example blew
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/employees/3 -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{"name": "Samwise Gamgee", "role": "ring bearer"}'

# Delete
if you want delete employee by id, you should type like the example blew
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/employees/1

# in Part3
I made Get,Post,Put system in Movie data

If you try to access a non-existent movieid, the error "Could not be found movie id" is output.

# Get
You can get the data through movieId.
if you want moviedata with Movieid(1), you should type like the example below
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/movies/1

then, you'll get (movieId, name, gerne) Json data

Even if it is not 1, it will all work within the existing movieId.

# Post
if you want register movie, you should type like the example bleow
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/movies -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{"name": "tt", "genre": "love"}'

POST requires only name and genre, and movieId is automatically generated by calculating the maximum value movieId from the collection and adding 1 to it. And this progarm return generated movieId.

movies.csv have 3952 movies, so if you post new movie, this movie's movieId will be 3953.

# Put
If you want modify movie, you should access moviedata though only movieId and your Request json type have to two datas(name, genre).

if you want modify movie, you should type like the example blew
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/movies/1 -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{"name": "Changed name", "genre": "Changed genre"}'

Even if it is not 1, it will all work within the existing movieId.

# Rating gte
if you want to get those movies rated greater than or equal to the given rating, you should type like the example blew
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/ratings/4

4 means rating that will be avg.
rating range is 1 to 5.
If you try to access a wrong rating, the error "this avg is wrong Range" is output.
